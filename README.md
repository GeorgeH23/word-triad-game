## Data Model
-   ### Google Sheets:
    - is used as a data source for storing the word lists for the Scramble and Hangman games.
-   ### Google API:
    - is used to access and retrieve data from Google Sheets document.
    - a service account and credentials are required for authentication and authorization.
-   ### Data Structure:
    - the word lists is stored in a dataFrame.
    - each row representing a word with an associated metadata such as difficulty level.
-   ### In-memory Data:
    - during the gameplay, the selected word list, the used words and scores are stored in memory.

## Issues and Bugs
-   ### Solved
    - The score of the Scramble game does not appear
        * I fixed the issue by moving the next-action code block at the end of the function.
    - The quit option wasn't work correctly
        * I fixed the issue by removing the call of the main function
